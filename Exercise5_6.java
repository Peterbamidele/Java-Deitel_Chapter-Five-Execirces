        //Compare and contrast the while and for repetition statements.
      /*  ANSWER: The while and for repetition statements repeatedly execute a statement or set of statements as long as a loop-continuation condition remains true.
        i. Both statements execute their bodies zero or more times. The for repetition statement specifies the counter-controlled-repetition details in its header,
        ii.while statement normally is initialized before the loop and incremented in the loop's body.
        iii.Typically, for statements are used for counter-controlled repetition,
        iv. while statements are used for sentinel-controlled repetition.
        v.while and for can each be used for either repetition type.**/
