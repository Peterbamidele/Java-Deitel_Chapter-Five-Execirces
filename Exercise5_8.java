       // Compare and contrast the break and continue statements.

        //ANSWER
        /*----BREAK----**/
        /* The break and continue statements alter the flow of control through a control statement.
        i.The break statement, when executed in one of the repetition statements, causes immediate exit from that statement.
        ii.Execution continues with the first statement after the control statement.

       In contrast.

       /*CONTINUE**/

       /*i.The continue statement, when executed in a repetition statement, skips the remaining statements in the loop body and proceeds
        with the next iteration of the loop.

       In while and do ... while statements, the program evaluates the loop-continuation test immediately after the continue statement executes.

       In a for statement, the increment expression executes, then the program evaluates the loop-continuation test.**/
