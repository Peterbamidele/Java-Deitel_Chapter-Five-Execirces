                i.Counter-controlled repetition requires a control variable (or loop counter),
                ii.an initial value of the control variable,
                iii.an increment (or decrement) by which the control variable is modified each time through the loop,
                iv.and a loop-continuation condition that determines whether looping should continue.**/
